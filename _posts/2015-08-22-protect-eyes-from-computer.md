Gamers, designers, software engineers usually suffer from eye strain or headaches by constantly staring at the monitors. Working in a place which has no natural light like basements or even in night time can be really harmful to your eyes.

Computer glasses or gunnar glasses can prevent the glare from your computer but they are quite expensive. An economic solution for this problem is flux.

## <span id="What_is_flux">What is flux?</span>

Flux is a software that adapts to your time and controls the brightness accordingly. It adds an orange tinge that doesn&#8217;t hurt your eyes. This happens because flux filters out strong blue light.

This is how it looks

I have been using flux for a long time and I recommend it to everyone. Actually I always had this feeling that everybody knows what flux is. Then I realized not many people use it.

I use my phone in the night to check some stats, mail and some browsing. Once I&#8217;m done browsing and when I try to sleep, I will realize that I shouldn&#8217;t have used my phone. It hurts my eyes and thus it is very hard to get any sleep afterwards.

When I came across flux, I used it on my laptop and I was really happy about the results. Then after some digging I found out an android app that does the same thing on smartphones called Twilight. Twilight has saved my eyes or at least has let me sleep peacefully.

Here is a screenshot of my phone with and without Twilight

Here is the official playstore link to <a href="https://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank">Twilight</a>

To use flux on iPhone, it should be jailbroken. Apple has restricted this for security reasons. But I don&#8217;t think jailbreaking is that hard!

I think these two apps are enough to protect eyes from display glare. If you have any suggestion or any other app that does the job then please leave a comment.
